# Pokedex-with-Javascript
A Pokedex model made using Javascript and the PokéAPI

It displays all the 151 pokemons from the first generation, with their names, types and Pokedex numbers Some features that I plan to add in the future:

A switch to change de regular sprites to their shiny counterparts
An option to click on the pokemon and see it's description base stats and other info
All the pokemon from generations 2 to 8
The option to choose what generations it'll choose
